Look back on the last year, the heavy work consume most of my time.<p>
In my company, programmger should do everything. I am the analyzer, programmer, doc writer, marketing staff, 
tester team leader and supporter of all product that I have touched. I Wrote asp, wrote java script, did test,
 wrote help documents, did supporting for application, even did product sales.<p>
I had little time to do real development. I feel deeply depressed. Go like this, I will lose my ardor on 
technology soon. I feel tired. I think it is why most programmer in china will jump to other field before 
30 year old. In fact, it is also why chinese software industry alwary stay in the low level. Because of the
 shortness of fund, the boss will not afford to hire enough staff, so most of the working is taken 
 by programmer. As a result, technicians can not concentrate on research and development. Consequently 
 the quality of software can not be level up, which leads to the predicament of finance.<p>
How to change the bad state? I think I should search some other way.
