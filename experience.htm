	1.	<b>At University, Student, 9/1995 - 7/1999:</b><br><br>
	I had written some DOS video games Using Turbo-C. In grade 3, my paper "DOS Video 2D Animation Technology research report" help me won the scholarship of "Shanghai University Novell Education Award"<br><br>
	I had written some tools for windows.<br><br>
	I passed the "Chinese Software Qualification Exam" and got the "Senior Programmer" certificate in grade 4.<br><br>
	My design for graduation is design a set of assembly system for one chip of EAST CHINA Computer institute, which includes the assembly instruction set, converter for the translation from assembly language to machine code and the chip emulating tools for windows. <br><br>
<p>
	2.	<b>Tose Software Inc, Programmer, 3/1999 ¨C 4/2000 :</b><br><br>
	After graduation I entered the TOSE Software Inc(Shanghai branch), took the programmer position and following project:<br><br>
	1.Wrote a tool for PS(play station) to auto-assign the memory for storing PS image.(using MFC, but the key is the algorithm for auto place image in memory)<br><br>
	2.Modify the JPEG algorithm to compress the image in PS memory.(Using pure c, but the key work is to make the algorithm use less memory and consume less CPU time)<br><br>
	3.An assembly language translator for Super-Nintendo(Z80 chip) to GameBoy(8086 chip), using pure c++ <br><br>
<p>
	3.	<b>Meining Software Inc., R&D Department, Leam Leader, Expert Group Member, Product Manager, 5/2000 to now:</b><br>	<br>
	1. From 5/2000 to 10/2000, I joined a group to develop one client software, which was a web site content viewer. Our web site user can use it to auto retrieve the data he costumed and communicate with other user.  I was the main programmer and responsible for the mainframe, XML data parsing, GUI(include skin and use MS Agent), and the IRC(one chat protocol) function. <br><br>
	2. From 10/2000 to 2/2000, I developed a News Audio Record software for our client, one Telephone-Info provider. Users can use it to record audio to Data Base. The key technology is implement the ADPCM Algorithm to convert input wave format audio to voc format audio.<br><br>
	3. From 1/2001 to 3, I started the research for one Application Platform. The goal of this platform is to provide a environment for enterprise to implement their business application more quickly and easily. Application developer will not need to take care of the database and the web page, because this platform will implement and capsule the data base detail, what is more, the expression layer will be extract from application layer. All is very like a middle ware, but this platform will be more special, but not very general. When research finished, we decided to use Script Engine and Object-Orient Data Access technology(support IBM DB2 , ORACLE, SQL SERVER).  <br><br>
	4. From 4/2001 to 5/2001, I finish the development of Scrip Engine. Script Engine is composed of tow module: compiler and virtual machine. Compiler includes Lexer, Parser, code generation; The VM is used to run the byte code generated by compiler. My script syntax is as same as some c syntax, and my VM is a non-stack VM, so it is very efficiency. I used the COCOR to generate the Lexer and parser( I prefer the bison/yacc, but I had only 1 month to complete all the coding task of Script Engine, and bison/yacc was more complex than COCOR).<br><br>
	5. From 6/2001 to 8/2001, I started the developing of the application platform. I was responsible for the windows service frame, client Lib&COM(used by web developer).<br><br>
	6. 9/2001, I used MS DOM and MFC to write a tools for the platform. Because all the application data on the platform is described by XML, so this tool is used to edit the application data structure. In addition , it can convert the data structure from XML to data base table structure, and auto create and alto corresponding table(support IBM-DB2 , ORACLE, SQL SERVER).<br><br>
	7. From 10/2001 to 12/2001, writing test tools and application for the platform. The Test tools include stress test tool and efficiency test tool. All tools is GUI based and multithread based. The test application is to test the usability of the platform. <br><br>
	8. From 1/2002 to 5/2002, transplant the old application of our web site onto the platform. I had been the product manager of the application platform.<br><br>
	9. 6/2002, Upgrade the platform£¬add transaction function.<br><br>
	10. 7/2002, Used java(jdk1.3) to write the frame of script Integrated development environment(IDE). Other team member then do the later development.<br><br>
	11. 8/2002, Upgrade the platform to improve the usability. I was the team leader.<br><br>
